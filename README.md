# WhiteWineEDA

This project is an exploratory data analysis on the white wine quality dataset, aiming to figure out how the input variables relate with the output variable, that is, to find out how white wine quality is effected by the chemicals. The white wine quality data is a tidy dataset with 4898 obeservations and 11 input variables–chemicals, and one output variable – quality.
